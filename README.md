This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of bike sales, 
focusing on four key areas.
First, it breaks down total revenue and profit, giving a clear picture of overall business performance.
Then, it explores trends over time, showing how revenue and profit have changed monthly and highlighting any patterns or shifts.
Seasonal revenue analysis reveals which times of the year drive the most sales, helping identify peak periods.
Lastly, the dashboard includes demographic insights, showing which customer groups contributing most to sales. 
Together, these views help understand business performance and guide strategic decisions.
